# Is Docker Bake Same as Bakery Foundation

To create a Dockerized Streamlit application that supports both x86 (Intel/AMD) and ARM architectures, you can utilize Docker's Buildx tool along with the `docker buildx bake` command. This approach enables the building of multi-platform images from a single configuration file.

**Step 1: Create a Simple Streamlit Application**

Begin by developing a basic Streamlit application. Create a file named `app.py` with the following content:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Hello, Streamlit!")
st.write("This is a simple Streamlit application.")
```


**Step 2: Write a Dockerfile**

Next, create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the Streamlit application:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python image as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port that Streamlit will run on
EXPOSE 8501

# Command to run the Streamlit application
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```


**Step 3: Specify Python Dependencies**

Create a `requirements.txt` file to list the necessary Python packages:

```

streamlit==1.3.0
```


**Step 4: Set Up Docker Buildx**

Ensure that Docker Buildx is installed and initialized on your system. You can verify this by running:

```bash
docker buildx version
```


If Buildx is not set up, initialize it with:

```bash
docker buildx create --use
```


**Step 5: Create a `docker-bake.hcl` File**

Define a `docker-bake.hcl` file to configure the multi-platform build:

```hcl
group "default" {
    targets = ["streamlit-app"]
}

target "streamlit-app" {
    context    = "."
    dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
    platforms  = ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"]
    tags       = ["yourusername/streamlit-app:latest"]
}
```


In this configuration:

- The `group` defines the default build target.
- The `target` specifies the build context, Dockerfile location, target platforms, and image tags.

**Step 6: Build and Push the Multi-Architecture Image**

Execute the following command to build and push the Docker image for both x86 and ARM architectures:

```bash
docker buildx bake --push
```


This command utilizes the `docker-bake.hcl` file to orchestrate the multi-platform build process. The `--push` flag uploads the built images to the specified Docker registry.

By following these steps, you can effectively containerize a Streamlit application and build Docker images compatible with both x86 and ARM architectures using Docker Buildx and the `docker buildx bake` command.
