# How to create a Docker Containers?

![Docker Architecture](images/docker_containers.png)
To create containers in Docker, you'll follow a few key steps. Below is a general guide on how to create and manage Docker containers.


### **1. Install Docker**

Before creating containers, make sure Docker is installed on your system.

- On Linux, you can install Docker using package managers like `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf` depending on your distribution.
- On Windows or macOS, you can download the Docker Desktop installer from the official Docker website.

### **2. Pull a Docker Image**

A Docker container is based on an image. Docker images are the templates used to create containers. To create a container, you first need to pull an image from Docker Hub or use a custom image.

For example, you can pull the official **Ubuntu** image:

```bash
docker pull ubuntu
```

This will download the **Ubuntu** image to your local machine.

### **3. Create a Container from an Image**

Once you've pulled the image, you can create a container from it. Use the `docker run` command to create and run a container:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

Explanation:
- `-it` runs the container in interactive mode and attaches a terminal so you can interact with it.
- `ubuntu` is the image you pulled earlier.

After running the command, Docker will create a container based on the **Ubuntu** image and open an interactive shell within the container.

### **4. Create a Container in Detached Mode**

If you want to create a container and run it in the background (detached mode), you can use the `-d` option:

```bash
docker run -d ubuntu
```

This will start the container in the background and print the container ID.

### **5. Create a Container with Custom Configuration**

You can also pass additional options to configure your container. For example, you can set environment variables, mount volumes, or map ports.

For example, to run a web server like Nginx and map port 80 from the container to port 8080 on your host:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

Explanation:
- `-p 8080:80` maps port 8080 on the host machine to port 80 on the container.
- `nginx` is the image being used to create the container.

### **6. Manage Containers**

After creating a container, you can manage it with the following Docker commands:

- **List Running Containers:**

```bash
docker ps
```

- **List All Containers (including stopped ones):**

```bash
docker ps -a
```

- **Stop a Running Container:**

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
```

- **Start a Stopped Container:**

```bash
docker start <container_id>
```

- **Remove a Container:**

```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

- **Enter a Running Container:**

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
```

This allows you to run commands inside the container.

### **7. Create a Custom Dockerfile (Optional)**

You can create a custom container image by writing a `Dockerfile`. This file contains instructions to build a Docker image.

Here’s an example of a simple Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Ubuntu base image
FROM ubuntu

# Set a working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy local files to the container
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

# Command to run when the container starts
CMD ["bash"]
```

- `FROM` specifies the base image.
- `WORKDIR` sets the working directory inside the container.
- `COPY` copies files from your local system to the container.
- `RUN` installs packages inside the container.
- `CMD` defines the default command to run when the container starts.

To build and run this custom image:

```bash
docker build -t my_ubuntu_image .
docker run -it my_ubuntu_image
```

### **8. Commit Changes to a Container (Optional)**

If you make changes to a container and want to save those changes to a new image, you can commit the changes:

```bash
docker commit <container_id> my_custom_image
```

This will create a new image (`my_custom_image`) based on the changes made in the container.
